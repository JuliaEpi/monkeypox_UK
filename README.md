# MonkeypoxUK

The `MonkeypoxUK` module provides methods for simulating MPX spread among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in the United Kingdom as well as the wider community. Weekly case data is from a combination of [ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox) and [UKHSA technical briefings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings).
